# Card-Company-Churn
This project is an analysis of the subscriber churn from a bank's card services.
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers "Credit Card customers"), and the analysis was run using MySQL (query file has been committed in this repository) and visualization done using Python.

**Steps Taken:**

In the analysis of the bank's card subscription data, the following steps were taken;

1. The bank's dataset was downloaded from Kaggle as CSV file.

2. The CSV file was imported into MySQL which was my DBMS where the analysis was carried out.

3. The analysis was performed to determine the attrition of subscribers based on different parameters such as age range, education level, marital status, gender, etc.

4. The results of the analysis were exported into a folder on my local device.

5. Subsequently, I used Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize my anaalysis and create web application web app using   Streamlit.
